# Toolkit
This is a "toolkit" I'm compiling of generalizable functions I use a lot in javascript. The most exciting thing in here right now is probably Wath.js, which I've been using to play around with a some math ideas, mostly pertaining to calculus and probability & statistics.
## Use
These files are currently a little bit interlinked, so if you want to use an entire file, you may need to end up using several, or unbraiding them. Because I'm actively working on these, I'm probably not going to create a min.js. But if you have any advice on best practices for a repository like this, don't hesitate to let me know!
## Upcoming
I'm most actively working on Wath.js right now, but I'll probably be adding other useful functions to the other files on an as-needed basis, now that they're all created. On Wath.js, I'm currently working on an interesting array shuffling algorithm, although it will less efficient than other algorithms (if I can even complete it). I'm experimenting with Riemann sums that use a non-uniform step size to improve accuracy, and I also hope to add a lot of linear algebra functionality very soon. 
## Playground
index.html, playground.js, and playgroundstyle.css all just exist for a place for me to experiment with my code.
## Credit
I avoid yoinking code as much as possible, I'm very diy. Where I have used code that doesn't belong to me, I've included a link to the original source (I think just 3-4 functions).
